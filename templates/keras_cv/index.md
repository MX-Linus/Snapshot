# KerasCV

KerasCV is a toolbox of modular building blocks (layers, metrics, losses, data augmentation) that computer vision engineers can leverage to quickly assemble production-grade, state-of-the-art training and inference pipelines for common use cases such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation, image data augmentation, etc.
