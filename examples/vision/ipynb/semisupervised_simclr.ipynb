    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semi-supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm that deals with\n",
    "**partially labeled datasets**. When applying deep learning in the real world,\n",
    "one usually has to gather a large dataset to make it work well. However, while\n",
    "the cost of labeling scales linearly with the dataset size (labeling each\n",
    "example takes a constant time), model performance only scales\n",
    "[sublinearly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) with it. This means that\n",
    "labeling more and more samples becomes less and less cost-efficient, while\n",
    "gathering unlabeled data is generally cheap, as it is usually readily available\n",
    "in large quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning offers to solve this problem by only requiring a\n",
    "partially labeled dataset, and by being label-efficient by utilizing the\n",
    "unlabeled examples for learning as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will pretrain an encoder with contrastive learning on the\n",
    "[STL-10](https://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/) semi-supervised dataset using\n",
    "no labels at all, and then fine-tune it using only its labeled subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contrastive learning\n",
    "\n",
    "On the highest level, the main idea behind contrastive learning is to **learn\n",
    "representations that are invariant to image augmentations** in a self-supervised\n",
    "manner. One problem with this objective is that it has a trivial degenerate\n",
    "solution: the case where the representations are constant, and do not depend at all on the\n",
    "input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrastive learning avoids this trap by modifying the objective in the\n",
    "following way: it pulls representations of augmented versions/views of the same\n",
    "image closer to each other (contracting positives), while simultaneously pushing\n",
    "different images away from each other (contrasting negatives) in representation\n",
    "space.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such contrastive approach is [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709),\n",
    "which essentially identifies the core components needed to optimize this\n",
    "objective, and can achieve high performance by scaling this simple approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is [SimSiam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566)\n",
    "([Keras example](https://keras.io/examples/vision/simsiam/)),\n",
    "whose main difference from\n",
    "SimCLR is that the former does not use any negatives in its loss. Therefore, it does not\n",
    "explicitly prevent the trivial solution, and, instead, avoids it implicitly by\n",
    "architecture design (asymmetric encoding paths using a predictor network and\n",
    "batch normalization (BatchNorm) are applied in the final layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading about SimCLR, check out\n",
    "[the official Google AI blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/advancing-self-supervised-and-semi.html),\n",
    "and for an overview of self-supervised learning across both vision and language\n",

    "## Improving further\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment in the original paper demonstrated that increasing the width and depth of the\n",
    "models improves performance at a higher rate than for supervised learning. Also,\n",
    "using a [ResNet-50](https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/#resnet50-function)\n",
    "encoder is quite standard in the literature. However keep in mind, that more\n",
    "powerful models will not only increase training time but will also require more\n",
    "memory and will limit the maximal batch size you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has [been](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09272)\n",
    "[reported](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722) that the usage of BatchNorm layers\n",
    "could sometimes degrade performance, as it introduces an intra-batch dependency\n",
    "between samples, which is why I did not have used them in this example. In my\n",
    "experiments however, using BatchNorm, especially in the projection head,\n",
    "improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameters used in this example have been tuned manually for this task and\n",
    "architecture. Therefore, without changing them, only marginal gains can be expected\n",
    "from further hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "However for a different task or model architecture these would need tuning, so\n",
    "here are my notes on the most important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch size**: since the objective can be interpreted as a classification\n",
    "over a batch of images (loosely speaking), the batch size is actually a more\n",
    "important hyperparameter than usual. The higher, the better.\n",
    "- **Temperature**: the temperature defines the \"softness\" of the softmax\n",
    "distribution that is used in the cross-entropy loss, and is an important\n",
    "hyperparameter. Lower values generally lead to a higher contrastive accuracy.\n",
    "A recent trick (in [ALIGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918)) is to learn\n",
    "the temperature's value as well (which can be done by defining it as a\n",
    "tf.Variable, and applying gradients on it). Even though this provides a good baseline\n",
    "value, in my experiments the learned temperature was somewhat lower\n",
    "than optimal, as it is optimized with respect to the contrastive loss, which is not a\n",
    "perfect proxy for representation quality.\n",
    "- **Image augmentation strength**: during pretraining stronger augmentations\n",
    "increase the difficulty of the task, however after a point too strong\n",
    "augmentations will degrade performance. During finetuning stronger\n",
    "augmentations reduce overfitting while in my experience too strong\n",
    "augmentations decrease the performance gains from pretraining. The whole data\n",
    "augmentation pipeline can be seen as an important hyperparameter of the\n",
    "algorithm, implementations of other custom image augmentation layers in Keras\n",
    "can be found in\n",
    "[this repository](https://github.com/beresandras/image-augmentation-layers-keras).\n",
    "- **Learning rate schedule**: a constant schedule is used here, but it is\n",
    "quite common in the literature to use a\n",
    "[cosine decay schedule](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/experimental/CosineDecay),\n",
    "which can further improve performance.\n",
    "- **Optimizer**: Adam is used in this example, as it provides good performance\n",
    "with default parameters. SGD with momentum requires more tuning, however it\n",
    "could slightly increase performance."
