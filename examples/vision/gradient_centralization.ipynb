    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This example implements [Gradient Centralization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01461), a new optimization technique for Deep Neural Networks by Yong et al., and demonstrates it on Laurence Moroney's [Horses or Humans Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/horses_or_humans). Gradient Centralization can both speedup training process and improve the final generalization performance of DNNs. It operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example requires TensorFlow 2.2 or higher, as well as a package I built, [gradient-centralization-tf](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Gradient-Centralization-TensorFlow), which can be installed using the following command:\n",

    "```py\n",
    "pip install gradient-centralization-tf\n",
