Description: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion using a custom image-caption dataset.
Accelerator: GPU
"""
"""
## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to fine-tune a
[Stable Diffusion model](https://keras.io/guides/keras_cv/generate_images_with_stable_diffusion/)
on a custom dataset containing {image,caption} pairs. We build on top of the fine-tuning
script provided by Hugging Face
[here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/text_to_image/train_text_to_image.py).

We assume that you have a high-level understanding of the Stable Diffusion model.
Following resources can be helpful if you're looking for resources in that regard:

* [High-performance image generation using Stable Diffusion in KerasCV](https://keras.io/guides/keras_cv/generate_images_with_stable_diffusion/)
* [Stable Diffusion with Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion)

It's highly recommended that you use a GPU having at least 30 GBs of memory to execute
the code.

By the end of the guide, you'll be able to generate images of interesting pokemons:

For the code, the tutorial relies on KerasCV 0.3.5 which is not yet available on PyPI.
So, we need to install it from the source.

"""
## What are we fine-tuning? 

A Stable Diffusion model can be decoupled into several key models:

* A text encoder that projects the input prompt to a latent space.
* A variational autoencoder (VAE) that projects an input image into a latent space acting
as an image encoder.
* A diffusion model that refines an input latent and produces another latent in the
presence of the encoded text prompt.
* A decoder that generates images given a latent from the diffusion model.

It's worth noting that during the process of generating an image from a text prompt, the
image encoder is not typically employed.

However, during the process of fine-tuning, the workflow goes like the following:

1. An input prompt is projected to a latent space by the text encoder. The caption
associated with an image is referred to as the prompt.
2. An input image is projected to a latent space by the image encoder portion of the VAE.
3. A small amount of noise is added to the image latent with a given timestep.
4. The diffusion model uses latents from these two spaces along with a timestep embedding
to predict the noise that was added to the image latent.
5. A reconstruction loss is calculated between the predicted noise and the original noise
added in step 3.
6. Finally, the diffusion model parameters are then optimized w.r.t this loss using
gradient descent.

Note that only the diffusion model parameters are updated during fine-tuning while the
text and the image encoders are kept frozen.

Don't worry if this reads complicated. The code is much simpler than this.

unlikely for a model that's trained using higher resolution images to transfer well to
lower resolution images. However, the current model will lead to OOM if we keep the

One important implementation detail to note here. Instead of directly taking
the latent produced by the image encoder (which is a VAE), we sample from the
mean and log-variance predicted by it. This way, we can achieve better sample
quality and diversity. 

It's common to add support for mixed-precision training along with exponential
moving averaging of model weights for fine-tuning these models. However, in the interest
of brevity, we discarded those elements. More on this later in the tutorial.

## Conclusion and acknowledgements

We demonstrated how to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model on a custom dataset. While
the results are far from aesthetically pleasing, we believe with more epochs of
fine-tuning, they will likely improve. To enable that, having support for gradient
accumulation and distributed training is crucial. This can be thought of as the next step
in this tutorial.

There is another interesting way in which Stable Diffusion models can be fine-tuned,
called textual inversion. You can refer to
[this tutorial](https://keras.io/examples/generative/fine_tune_via_textual_inversion/)
to know more about it.

We'd like to acknowledge the GCP Credit support from ML Developer Programs' team at
Google. We'd like to thank the Hugging Face team for providing the
[fine-tuning script](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/text_to_image/train_text_to_image.py)
